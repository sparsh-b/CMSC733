# Classical Computer Vision assignments done as part of the course CMSC733
## Assignment 1: 
  - <b>Hybrid Image</b>: Superposing a low-frequency component of an image & a high-frequency component of another image allows you to see both the images at once.
  - <b>Image Pyramids</b>: Gaussian & Laplacian pyramids enable multi-scale representation of images. They have many applications in image blending, editing & texture synthesis.
  - <b>Edge Detection</b>: Gradient-based edge detector is coded from scratch.
  - <b>Template Matching</b>: A SSD (Sum of Squared Differences) based template matching algorithm is implemented.

## Assignment 2:
  - <b>Feature Detection & Tracking</b>: Implemented a Harris operator based corner detector followed by Non-maxima Suppression to select a few good keypoints & used the Kanade-Lucas-Tomasi procedure to track the movement of those keypoints in a video.
  - <b>Shape Alignment</b>: Given two shape outlines (masks) of similar objects, Iterative Closest Point Algorithm is used to find a transformation matrix between them.
  - <b>Object Instance Recognition</b>: Using SIFT-features of keypoints in 2 images Lowe-style object instance recognition is implemented.
