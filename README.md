# Classical Computer Vision assignments done as part of the course CMSC733
## Assignment 1: 
  - <b>Hybrid Image</b>: Superposing a low-frequency component of an image & a high-frequency component of another image allows you to see both the images at once.
  - <b>Image Pyramids</b>: Gaussian & Laplacian pyramids enable multi-scale representation of images. They have many applications in image blending, editing & texture synthesis.
  - <b>Edge Detection</b>: Gradient-based edge detector is coded from scratch.
  - <b>Template Matching</b>: A SSD (Sum of Squared Differences) based template matching algorithm is implemented.
